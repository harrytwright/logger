## ROADMAP

### v3.X.X

- Move redactions to a npm workspace. This will allow them to be updated and version controlled better, and we can update them all
  at the same time, or w/ a custom publish script to check for changes etc
- Custom Formats (could come in v3.1.0-beta)
- Allowing for JSON to be forced w/ or w/o production i.e LOGGER_JSON=true/false

### v3.1.X

- Add a very rough concept for progress bar to the mix, or grouped messages via $\_\_unsafe_progress()
